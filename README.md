 I have been doing some experimenting with sound and .obj files within p5.js, regarding timing, animations, and other effects. I have mostly been referencing the p5 reference library, using what we work on in class as a starting point and expanding from there.

 These explorations eventually led to the current WIP version of the sounding body sketch.

 The next steps for the project are to complete the cast of my chest and 3D scan it into the program (it will replace the flesh-colored box) and add suitable sound effects, then fine-tune the sounds, timing, and display until I am content with it.
