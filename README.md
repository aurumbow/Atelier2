# SoundingBody-Final

The final version is the same as what was outlined in the process documentation - the fingers move around the chest cast in a sort of mock surgical gesture.

This project was a lot harder for me to work on than it probably should have been, as I struggle a lot with working with bodies and sound, and I really cannot stand to be recorded in any great capacity (photos, videos, etc). 

The main issues I ran into working on the project were mostly with the casting process, as it lays very far outside the usual realm of what I practice and was therefore entirely new content to be learning as I worked. In contrast, P5 and programming are things I am familiar with so that section of the project was easy to complete from where I had left off in the process report.
