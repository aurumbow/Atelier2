# ExChanging_Body

It's a jackalope, which you can force to be a rabbit. Our original idea was to demonstrate "killng something by destroying it's body", though it can be interpreted in other ways. I thought of it as a piece about the dangers of forcing an identity onto something else, while someone who saw me working on it interpreted it as a piece about the environment and human intervention.

We wanted to explore the idea of juxtaposing something creepy (realistic fingers mashed into the shape of something else, playing with body horror as a concept) with something cute (a bunny). A non-real creature that is a mashing together of two animals seemed like a good framework from which to approach this presentation, so I proposed that we make a jackalope - a creature that is a combination of a rabbit or hare with deer antlers.

When the audience removes the "uncanny parts" (the tail or antlers) from the rabbit, it bleeds out its stuffing and 'dies'.
The rabbit is stuffed with mostly filling beans that were red or pink in color, with some cotton balls and some foam hearts to represent it's organs. These replaced the original stuffing of the rabbit both because they would fall out easier, and because they more closely resembled the proper interior of a real rabbit. 

There were some difficulties regarding the combination of the elements, but ultimately they came together in what I think is a fairly satisfying way. The components come apart and back together easily and intuitively, and go back together pretty quickly.
